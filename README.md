# aiven-demo

This folder contains two files:

In simple-text-producer-consumer.ipynb file I play with the Kafka producer and consumer using the Aiven server.

In simple-json-producer-consumer.ipynb file I download json data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, use kafka producer to move the data to Aiven server, read the data with kafka consumer and move it to Postres database hosted by Aiven.
